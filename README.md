If a window opens and asks for Administrator privileges, allow it.  
You can also disable this annoying message following this guide: https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/user-account-control-uac-on-windows-10  

When the program starts for the first time, it asks for your Afeka credentials.  
This screen will show every time after you chose to stop checking. This way you can also switch between years and semesters:

The following checks will send an email only if a new grade is found.**  
The program automatically starts when the computer powers on, and constantly checks based on the interval you choose.  
**If you wish to stop checking or change semester/credentials**, click “Stop Checking and Exit” and re-run the program.  
The program can be uninstalled using the installer or via the “Add or remove programs” sections in the Control Panel.  
Enjoy!
